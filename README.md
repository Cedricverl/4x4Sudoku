# 4x4Sudoku
Solves 3x3 and 4x4 sudoku using Crook's algorithm and backtracking. 
Using this hybrid method is much faster than brute-forcing the sudoku.

Use board templates from `board_templates.py` or create your own and
change the board name in `sudoku.py`, then run and let the magic do its work.
